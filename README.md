We'll explore Python tools for working with one-dimensional data (e.g. arrays) and two-dimensional data (e.g. spreadsheets), including NumPy and pandas, respectively.  We'll explore the string class and let you know that regular expressions exist to help us identify and parse elements of text (e.g. find all the phone numbers or web addresses).
